# DroneSimulator

Project designed to simulate quadcopter behavior in a semi-complex manner (due to limited computation capacity). 
Rendering will be using OpenGL mostly for learning purposes. 
End goal is to use reinforcement learning to guide drones in a 3D environment to reach a target goal as fast as possible.
